## Summary 

The quantity for non-vine reviews is very high in comparison to the vine reviews. This gives more veracity to the non-vine reviewers dataset and shows a higher than 50% 5-star review rating percentage. The vine reviews have an insignificant amount of reviews in total (49) with only 18% of their reviews being 5-star ratings. 

The data supports that the vine program needs more incentives for reviewers to join, for example a member only discount based on how many reviews you give a month.
